    ### Historical Context
    The Cold War (1947-1991) was a period of intense geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
    Following World War II, these two superpowers emerged with diametrically opposed ideologies: American capitalism and 
    democracy versus Soviet communism and authoritarianism.
    
    ### Game Overview
    You are the leader of a major power during the Cold War. Your decisions will shape the course of history. 
    Each choice you make will lead to different historical paths and challenges. The story will evolve based on 
    your decisions, creating a unique experience each time you play.
    
    ### Game Rules
    - You start with 10 Diplomatic Points
    - Global Tension starts at 20 (game over if it reaches 100)
    - Public Opinion starts at 50 (game over if it reaches 0)
    - Each decision will lead to new challenges and opportunities
